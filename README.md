# Automatic Speech Recognition 2020 project
Repository for my Jupyter Notebooks containing the code for my REMA ASR project. 

Data Generation.ipynb is for generating the overlapping audio files from the separate TIMIT utterances and the spectrograms.
Counting_experiment.ipynb is the code with the actual experiment, including the models used in the experiment.

Code created in collaboration with [@Merel](https://github.com/MerelAW)
